## Problem 1

1.  I am trying to create a dataframe as request.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

    ## ── Attaching packages ─────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 1.3.1 ──

    ## ✓ ggplot2 3.3.5     ✓ purrr   0.3.4
    ## ✓ tibble  3.1.4     ✓ dplyr   1.0.7
    ## ✓ tidyr   1.1.3     ✓ stringr 1.4.0
    ## ✓ readr   2.0.1     ✓ forcats 0.5.1

    ## ── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──
    ## x dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()
    ## x dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()

``` r
create_df = tibble(
  norm_samp = rnorm(10),
  logical_vec = norm_samp > 0,
  char_vec = c("a","b","c","d","e","f","g","h","i","j"),
  factor_vec = factor(c("small", "median","large","samll","median","large","samll","median","large", "samll"))
)
```

I have created a dataframe with a random sample, a logical vector, a
character vector and a factor vector.

2.  I am trying to take the mean of each variable in your dataframe.

-   for the mean of random norm sample.

``` r
mean_norm = mean(pull(create_df, norm_samp))
```

It works! It is -0.2455808

-   for the mean of logical vector.

``` r
mean_log = mean(pull(create_df, logical_vec))
```

It works! It is 0.4

-   for the mean of character vector.

``` r
mean_char = mean(pull(create_df, char_vec))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(create_df, char_vec)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

It does not work.

-   for the mean of factor vector.

``` r
mean_factor = mean(pull(create_df, factor_vec))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(create_df, factor_vec)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

It does not work.

3.  I am trying to use as.numeric function on the logical, character,
    and factor variables.

``` r
numeric_logical = as.numeric(pull(create_df, logical_vec))
numeric_char = as.numeric(pull(create_df, char_vec))
numeric_factor = as.numeric(pull(create_df, factor_vec))
```

as.numeric function could change the logical and factor variables into
numbers, but it does not work on character vector. That could because
logical could be saved as “0” and “1” and factor could be saved as
ordinal numbers. But character cannot be saved by numbers.

However, when it comes to get the mean, things could be different for
factor variables. Because that the ordinal numbers cannot represent the
actual meaning of the factor levels, so that we cannot get the mean of a
factor by just calculate the relative number of the levels.

## Problem 2

1.  Input data “penguins”.

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

2.  get more knowledge about the dataset.

``` r
names(penguins)
```

    ## [1] "species"           "island"            "bill_length_mm"   
    ## [4] "bill_depth_mm"     "flipper_length_mm" "body_mass_g"      
    ## [7] "sex"               "year"

``` r
nrow(penguins)
```

    ## [1] 344

``` r
ncol(penguins)
```

    ## [1] 8

3.  get the mean flipper length.

``` r
mean_flipper = mean(pull(penguins, flipper_length_mm), na.rm = TRUE)
```

4.  Make a scatterplot!

``` r
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) + geom_point()
```

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (geom_point).

5.  Export my scatterplot

``` r
ggsave("scatterplot.pdf", height = 4, width = 6)
```

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (geom_point).
